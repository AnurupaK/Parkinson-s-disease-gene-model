# Parkinson-s-disease-gene-model
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of neurons in a brain region called the substantia nigra, leading to a deficiency of dopamine in the striatum. It is also associated with the presence of intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of a protein called α-synuclein. The molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease involve various pathways and processes. These include disturbances in α-synuclein proteostasis (the regulation of protein folding and degradation), impairment of mitochondrial function (the energy-producing organelles in cells), oxidative stress (an imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants), disruption of calcium homeostasis (the balance of calcium ions in cells), defects in axonal transport (the movement of cellular components along nerve fibers), and neuroinflammation (inflammation in the nervous system). In addition to these molecular factors, certain genes have been identified that contribute to an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. These genes can either increase or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease. To analyze the genetic factors involved in Parkinson's disease, the algorithm has been developed. This algorithm focuses on identifying upregulated genes that have a higher contribution to the disease and downregulated genes that have a lesser contribution. By creating a network of the upregulated genes, performing community detection (identifying clusters of genes that closely interact with each other), and analyzing the resulting network, the algorithm can identify the important genes responsible for Parkinson's disease.
